# Machine Learning - Stanford Online/Coursera

This well known course by Andrew Ng is based on Stanford CS229 Machine Learning subject. It covers a broad range of algorithms such as Logistic Regression, SVMs, Neural Networks, Clustering, PCA, Collab Filtering and Recommender Systems.

Exercises from Introduction to Machine Learning, written in Octave/MATLAB programming language. Each folder has a main Jupyter notebook file named **ex{n}.ipynb**.
